;; This is a poor person's version of OS-specific mechanisms like
;; FindFirstFileChangeNotification on Windows and fsevents on OS X.
;; Instead this does a checksum of a path's contents, running a thread
;; to check periodically.
;;
;; A version of this which _does_ use FFI to access OS-specific
;; services would be great.

;; (require racket/runtime-path)
