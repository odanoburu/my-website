I'm a first-year PhD student in the @link["https://uwplse.org"]{PLSE} and @link["https://unsat.org"]{UNSAT} groups at the @link["https://www.cs.washington.edu"]{University of Washington}, advised by @link["https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~emina/"]{Emina Torlak}. My interest is in programming languages and formal methods.

Before joining grad school, I graduated from Brown University with an Sc.B. degree in CS, working with @link["https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/"]{Shriram Krishnamurthi} and @link["https://cs.brown.edu/~tbn/"]{Tim Nelson}.
