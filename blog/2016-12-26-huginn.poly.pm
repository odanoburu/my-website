Yahoo! @link["http://lifehacker.com/yahoo-pipes-is-closing-down-1709067642"]{terminated} Yahoo! Pipes on June 4, 2015. It breaks my heart to see another good service dying. However, I recently found another project which has an ability just like Yahoo! Pipes: @link["github.com/cantino/huginn"]{Huginn}

Huginn seems to be more robust than Yahoo! Pipes, actually. The downside is that it is much more difficult to set things up. Also, it's just an app. I need to either set up a local server to run it or host it somewhere. Since I'm too lazy to maintain the local server, I hosted it with Heroku. With the free plan, there are a lot of restrictions, but this should be enough for the basic tasks I want to do.
